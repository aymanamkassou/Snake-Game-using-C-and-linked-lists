# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using C programming language. The game allows the player to control a snake and navigate it around the grid to eat prey while avoiding collisions with itself.

## Features

- User input for controlling the snake's direction (N - North, S - South, E - East, W - West).
- Randomly generated prey on the grid.
- Game over condition when the snake collides with itself.
- Display of the game grid showing the snake, prey, and empty spaces.
